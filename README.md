###Weather JavaScript project###

#It's simple project for fun. I used [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/) to show weather data of cities.
Other things I used in this project:
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - for my webpage "design",
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) - for wind, pressure and humidity icons,
- Google Images

  If you want to test my webpage you can do it [here](https://barmcoovy.github.io/weather/)
