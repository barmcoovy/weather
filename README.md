# Weather JavaScript project

##### It's simple project for fun. I used [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/) to show weather data of cities.
Other things I used in this project:
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/){:target="_blank"} - for my webpage "design",
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com){:target="_blank"} - for wind, pressure and humidity icons,
- Google Images

  If you want to test my webpage you can do it [here](https://barmcoovy.github.io/weather/){:target="_blank"}
